# NYC Citibike Analysis Challenge 14

## Overview of Project

The premise of this project was to develop a story to convince a group of investors in starting a bike-sharing idea in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to achieve this task, data was imported into Tableau and this data was utilized to create and style worksheets as well as dashboards. The final step involved presenting the data in professional manner using stories. Please see below for the analysis deliverables.

- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Date time Format

- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results

- Visualization 1 - Total Number of Riders: The total number of riders is 2,344,224. 

- Visualization 2 - Top Starting Locations: The majority of users are in a centralized location and as the radius grows larger, the number of users shrinks. Initial thoughts suggested that this might be due to a large portion of users being tourists. 

- Visualization 3 - Classification of bike-sharing users: The percentage of total riders that are subscribers provide an optimistic outlook for the program in Des Moines. A large concern that was initially identified was that more users were tourists rather than subscribers (or a consistent flow of users). 

- Visualization 4 - Checkout times by Users: The majority of users tend to use the bikes from anywhere between 1-20 minutes. The most popular checkout time being a duration of 5 minutes. Thus indicating that users mostly use it for short distance traveling (i.e. going to work, shopping, etc.). 

- Visualization 5 - Checkout times by Gender: The majority of users tend to use the bikes from anywhere between 1-20 minutes. The most popular duration being 5 minutes regardless of gender, however, most users tend to be male. The same conclusion as visualization 4 can be observed here as well which is that most users tend to use the bikes for short distance traveling. 

- Visualization 6 - Trips by Weekend per Hour: The most popular times for the bike-sharing program seem to be on Thursdays. Particularly at 8 AM and between 5-6 PM. However, there is also a lot of optimism for the weekends and weekday mornings. 

- Visualization 7 - Trips by Gender: The most popular start times during morning weekdays for all genders seems lie between 7-9 AM. When it comes to the weekday evenings, 5-6 PM are the most popular times for M-W & TH. 

- Visualization 8 - User Trips by Gender by Weekday: Male subscribers appear to be the largest demographic of bike-sharing users during August followed by female subscribers. This is not the case when users are simply customers, but this result provides high optimism that the Des Moines, Iowa bike-sharing program can be successful if properly marketed to male individuals in the region. 

## Summary

Overall, there is a high chance of success for the bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. The first reason being that the majority of users are subscribers which indicate a consistent flow of income rather than sporadic income. The second reason is that the majority users want to utilize the bikes for short distances which is ideal for a city such as Des Moines especially if the users are within commutable distance to work and other popular activities. 

Aside from the probability of success, the majority of subscribers are male. Indicating that when setting up this program in Des Moines, a strong focus of marketing should be placed on males. To increase precision, an additional visualization utilizing the citibikes records and birth dates should be explored. This might provide additional insight and assistance in selecting regions for positioning the bikes in order to maximize usage and the success of this program. 

Lastly, one additional parameter that should be explored is bike id and user types. This might provide insight into which types of bikes are most commonly are used if there is a selection among the bikes available. It might bolster female subscriber usage as well if there is a certain type of bike(s) that are tailored to their needs and/or desires better.
